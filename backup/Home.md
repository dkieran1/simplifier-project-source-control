## Child Protection Implementation Guide

This specification provides guidance on how Child Protection information is exchanged between Local Authority and healthcare IT systems. Currently, this exchange is taking place in unscheduled care settings using the HL7 V3 standard. This guide will initially describe how these existing messages are being translated into the [HL7 FHIR R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/) standard.

At this stage of development, only the following care communications will be converted to FHIR-based message exchanges:-

- CP-IS NHS Query
- CP-IS NHS Query response
