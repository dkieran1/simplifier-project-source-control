## FHIR Assets

This section lists all the FHIR Assets available in the CP-IS  Implementation Guide.

The Assets are rendered in several formats: 

- Snapshot: a fully calculated form of the structure that is not dependent on any other structure
- Hybrid: a hybrid view of the snapshot and differential views
- Differential: this describes only the differences that the profile makes relative to the structure definition they constrain 

Not all views are applicable to all FHIR Asset types.
